Bootstrap grid system provides the quick and easy way to create responsive website layouts. As opposed to the previous Bootstrap 2.x grid system which is fixed by default, the new version, i.e. Bootstrap 3 introduces the responsive mobile first fluid grid system that appropriately scales up to 12 columns as the device or viewport size increases.

Bootstrap 3 includes predefined grid classes for quickly making grid layouts for different types of devices like cell phones, tablets, laptops and desktops, etc. For example, you can use the .col-xs-* class to create grid columns for extra small devices like cell phones, similarly the .col-sm-* class for small screen devices like tablets, the .col-md-* class for medium size devices like desktops and the .col-lg-* for large desktop screens. The following table summarizes some of the key features of the new grid system

</div>
<div class="col-sm-3" style="background-color:lavender;">

Above table demonstrates one important thing, applying any .col-sm-* class to an element will not only affect its styling on small devices, but also on medium and large devices having a screen size greater than or equal to 768px (i.e. ≥768px) if .col-md-* and .col-lg-* class is not present. Similarly the .col-md-* class will not only affect the styling of elements on medium devices, but also on large devices if a .col-lg-* class is not present.

at first create a container that acts as a wrapper for your rows and columns using the .container class, after that create rows inside the container using the .row class, and to create columns inside any row you can use the class .col-xs-*, .col-sm-*, .col-md-* and .col-lg-*. The columns are actual content area where we will place our contents. Let's put all these things into real action.

Why this tutorial exists

I wrote this tutorial because I had a pretty tough time getting Rails and Angular to talk to each other as an SPA. The best resource I could find out there was Ari Lerner’s Riding Rails with AngularJS. I did find that book very helpful and I thought it was really well-done, but it seems to be a little bit out-of-date by now and I couldn’t just plug in its code and have everything work. I had to do a lot of extra Googling and head-scratching to get all the way there. This tutorial is meant to be a supplement to Ari’s book, not a replacement for it. I definitely recommend buying the book because it really is very helpful.
The sample app

There’s a certain sample app I plan to use throughout AngularOnRails.com called Lunch Hub. The idea with Lunch Hub is that office workers can announce in the AM where they’d like to go for lunch rather than deciding as they gather around the door and waste half their lunch break. Since Lunch Hub is a real project with its own actual production code, I use a different project here called “Fake Lunch Hub.” You can see the Fake Lunch Hub repo here. I also created a branch specifically to match up with this tutorial here.
Setting up our Rails project

Instead of regular Rails we’re going to use Rails::API. I’ve tried to do Angular projects with full-blown Rails, but I end up with a bunch of unused views, which feels weird. First, if you haven’t already, install Rails::API.

Background
Wikipedia was initially conceived as a feeder project for the Wales-founded Nupedia, an earlier project to produce a free online encyclopedia, volunteered by Bomis, a web-advertising firm owned by Jimmy Wales, Tim Shell and Michael E. Davis.[14][15][16] Nupedia was founded upon the use of highly qualified volunteer contributors and an elaborate multi-step peer review process.[17] Despite its mailing list of interested editors, and the presence of a full-time editor-in-chief, Larry Sanger, a graduate philosophy student hired by Wales,[18] the writing of content for Nupedia was extremely slow, with only 12 articles written during the first year.[16]

Wales and Sanger discussed various ways to create content more rapidly.[15] The idea of a wiki-based complement originated from a conversation between Larry M. Sanger and Ben Kovitz.[19][20][21] Ben Kovitz was a computer programmer and regular on Ward Cunningham's revolutionary wiki "the WikiWikiWeb". He explained to Sanger what wikis were, at that time a difficult concept to understand, over a dinner on Tuesday 2 January 2001.[19][20][21][22] Wales first stated, in October 2001, that "Larry had the idea to use Wiki software",[23] though he later stated in December 2005 that Jeremy Rosenfeld, a Bomis employee, introduced him to the concept.[24][25][26][27] Sanger thought a wiki would be a good platform to use, and proposed on the Nupedia mailing list that a wiki based upon UseModWiki (then v. 0.90) be set up as a "feeder" project for Nupedia. Under the subject "Let's make a wiki", he wrote:
